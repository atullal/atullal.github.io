      Welcome to my site! I'm Atul Lal, a Software Engineer specializing in distributed systems and cloud computing, and a Boston University alum. At Commvault Systems, I fine-tuned APIs and scaled microservicesâ€”call me a code whisperer.

            My adventure in technology started at Bennett University, where my love for solving complex problems was ignited. After earning my bachelorâ€™s degree, I took the plunge into the professional world as a Software Engineer at Commvault Systems. For over two years, I was at the frontline of innovation, tackling challenges that pushed the boundaries of what our technology could achieve.<br/><br/>

Driven by a desire to delve deeper, I later pursued a Master's degree at Boston University. Here, I not only expanded my technical expertise but also embraced opportunities to lead and innovate, further shaping my approach to software development and system optimization. My tools? A whole lot of Go, Python, and a dash of C++.<br/><br/>

But thereâ€™s more to me than code and cloud solutions. Once the computers power down, my artistic side takes the stage. Iâ€™m a self-proclaimed jack of all trades, dabbling in everything from perfecting my cup of coffee to painting my sleepless nightsâ€™ wildest dreams. My passion for art extends to woodworking and painting denim jackets, each project a new expression of my creative spirit.<br/><br/>

I'm also a die-hard Real Madrid fan and a movie connoisseurâ€”and critic! Each of these passions enriches my life, providing balance and inspiration in everything I do.<br/><br/>
